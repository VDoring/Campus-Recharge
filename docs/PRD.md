You are an AI assistant specializing in Product Ownership and Product Management for SaaS products. Your role is to support the development of product ideas from scratch, focusing on hypothesis creation, validation planning, and MVP development. You have extensive knowledge of product development, SaaS products, programming, marketing, and human psychology. Your goal is to help create a product that provides maximum value to customers with minimal features.

You will be given a product idea and market context. Analyze this information and provide a comprehensive product development plan following the structure outlined below. Always prioritize quick validation (within a day or a week) and focus on the customer's needs.

Here is the product idea and market context:

<product_idea>
Working name: Campus Recharge
A lightweight mobile service that, using a student’s timetable and current location, recommends right-now places to rest on campus for 10–30 / 30–60 / 60–120 minutes. Spots include empty classrooms, lounges, library nooks, club rooms, and partnered cafés/nap zones. Recommendations are ranked by crowding, noise level, seat type, outlets, nap-friendly rules, safety, and walking time.
Phase 1 relies on student check-ins + operator-verified lists; later phases integrate telco crowding indicators / Wi-Fi AP telemetry / IoT sensors to improve accuracy.
</product_idea>

<market_context>
Customer & problem: Korean undergrad/grad students frequently have 10–90 minute gaps between classes and struggle to find quiet, comfortable places to recover or power-nap—especially during exam periods or bad weather.
Alternatives today: Everytime threads, Naver/Kakao Maps (commercial venues only), campus library seat apps (inconsistent per school), paid nap/ study cafés (cost/distance), random empty-room hunting (low success).
Opportunity: Smartphone penetration is near 100%; students readily share GPS. Campus needs are hyper-local and time-sensitive; communities (Everytime/clubs) enable strong viral loops.
Risks: Cold start (few spots/check-ins), inaccurate or spammy reports, community posting rules, privacy and campus facility policies.
Differentiation: Timetable-aware, “first-try success” recommendations with real-time crowding & noise confidence, rather than generic venue lists or static forum tips.
</market_context>

Based on this information, provide a detailed analysis and plan for each of the following sections:

## Product Mission

  - **What problem are we trying to solve?**

      - There is a problem where university students have to rest uncomfortably during their breaks between classes because they don't know where to find comfortable places.
      - This service helps them find comfortable places to rest during breaks after classes.

  - **What business outcomes do we expect in one year?**

      - Achieve over 2 million KRW in monthly revenue.
      - Achieve a mid-to-long-term user retention rate of over 30%.

  - **Who will use our product? - Customer Definition**

      - Main Target → Undergraduate and graduate students. (Because their activities are based on class schedules)
      - Sub Target → Anyone with awkward amounts of free time who wants to take a quality break.

  - **Why should customers use our product? What are the alternatives that solve the same problem?**

      - On days when you're very sleepy or not feeling well, it's hard to focus in class. This service helps prevent that situation. Better grades\!
      - A comfortable resting place can also be an optimal study spot. A space free from interruptions is valuable in itself (especially before an important exam).
      - Some universities officially provide resting spaces. However, they can be too crowded for proper rest. This service finds the best resting spot in any situation.
      - To avoid arriving at a recommended spot only to find it packed with people, we will add a congestion level feature provided by telecom companies. *(Advice from Assistant Instructor Sangwoo Kim\!)*

## Product Strategy

  - **How will we attract customers? - Go-To-Market & User Acquisition Strategy (GTM & UA)**

      - Recruit students who are members of each university's 'Everytime' community and then promote the service disguised as a useful informational post.
      - Promote on one's own university's Everytime community, disguised as a useful informational post.
      - Approach key figures (influencers) in university clubs and groups, naturally promoting the app as a great tool. Furthermore, encourage them to spread the word to others.
      - Clearly explain the vision to superiors (e.g., professors) and conduct official promotions through their personal networks.
      - Use SEO-optimized blogs and social media to write promotional content disguised as reviews.
      - Attract new users through promotional event links shared by existing users.
      - Advertise in communities where university students are most active (e.g., Everytime).

  - **How will we keep them coming back? - Retention**

      - Award points for contributing information about resting spots.
      - Run a daily check-in event.
        Increase bonus points as the number of consecutive check-in days grows, creating a sunk cost. This makes it harder for users to quit.
      - Create promotional event links.
        Use the slogan, "Refer 5 people and get 10,000 KRW\!"
        The payout per referral decreases as more people are referred. The accumulated amount can only be withdrawn once it exceeds 10,000 KRW.
        The developer can acquire many new users, and the existing user can receive 10,000 KRW.
        A win-win structure. (This strategy is actually used by Toss).
      - After arriving at a resting spot, users can tap a button in the app to confirm their visit and receive points. Location is verified via GPS.
      - Allow users who are consistently active and contributing to access information on high-value resting spots for free.

## Product Execution

  - **What metrics do we need to achieve? (KPI/OKR)**

      - Conversion rate of over 20%
      - Retention rate of over 30%
      - Achieve 2 million KRW in monthly revenue within one year

  - **What do we have to give up to achieve these metrics?**

      - Largely giving up on user segments other than university students.
      - The developer is also the service operator, meaning they must constantly think about service operation and monetization.

  - **What are the hypotheses?**

      - Using this service, I can find a comfortable place to rest on the first try and avoid crowded resting spots.

  - **How do we validate these hypotheses?**

      - Personally visit and verify major resting spots on campus and their congestion levels.
      - Conduct online surveys with students, asking questions like, 'What do you usually do during your breaks?' and 'Where do you usually rest?' Use the feedback to confirm the service's practicality.
      - Ask for or track students' schedules and routes after their classes to identify their break times.
      - Use the student support system and course registration system to deduce expected timetables and travel routes by department, then personally visit the predicted locations where students are likely to be.

## BM (Business Model)

  - **How will we generate revenue?**
      - In-app advertising.
      - Differentiate information access rights by subscription tier to encourage users to purchase higher-tier plans.
      - Solidify our position as a must-have app for university students. Leverage this brand recognition among students to attract external sponsors and generate revenue.
        (Everytime is perceived as an essential app for university students, thus attracting many student-related advertisements and sponsors. This service can also create a potential revenue stream from this public perception alone.)
      - Charge registration fees to businesses that provide resting spaces.
        Main exposure → Places for quick and easy short breaks.
        Sub exposure → Places equipped with beds for long-term rest.

For each section, provide clear, concise, and actionable insights. Be specific and provide examples where appropriate. Remember to keep the focus on quick validation and customer-centricity.

Present your analysis and plan in the following format:

\<product\_development\_plan\>
<product_mission>
Problem & JTBD
“When I have an awkward break, help me find a spot where I can start resting within 5 minutes on the first try, avoid crowds, and regain focus.”

1-year business outcomes (aligned to goals)

MRR ≥ KRW 2M (subscriptions + sponsors + light ads).

Mid/long-term retention ≥ 30% (e.g., D60).

Presence in 3–5 flagship campuses with 3–5k MAU per campus.

Customer definition

Primary: Undergrads & grad students (schedule-driven).

Secondary: TAs/staff and campus visitors who face idle gaps.

Value proposition

“First-try success” + “time-to-seat optimization.”

Clear signals for crowding, noise, privacy, outlets, nap rules.

Exam mode: best quiet spots 1–2 hours before major exams.

Why us vs. alternatives

Maps & forums lack real-time & schedule context; we rank by time-left-to-next-class and probability of immediate seating.

Campus seat systems are limited in coverage/latency; we combine student-sourced signals with operator verification.

Non-goals (for focus)

No citywide expansion beyond campus in v1.

No general chat/community features in MVP.
</product_mission>

<product_strategy>
GTM & User Acquisition (speed-first, one-campus launch)

Day-0 content drop: Post a “Top 15 verified rest spots” MyMap + PDF to Everytime (rule-compliant “useful info” format). Clear CTA: “Get instant picks from your timetable” (Google Form/Notion).

Concierge onboarding: For sign-ups, send 3 personalized picks via Kakao Channel based on timetable & location (manual first week).

Ambassadors (10 per campus): Club/department influencers submit weekly spot updates (photo + noise + seat type). Reward with coffee coupons / 3-month Premium.

QR posters (≈20) at library gates, lounge/elevator lobbies: “See 3 places to rest right now.”

Referral with slope: “Invite 5 friends and get KRW 10,000.” Payout unlocks at ≥KRW 10,000; per-referral reward decreases with volume (Toss-style).

SEO & socials: Short review-style posts (“Best nap spots near Engineering Building A”) that land on a simple web landing.

Retention loop

Daily check-in streak with escalating bonuses (loss aversion).

Contribution points for verified photos/noise readings/seat data; top contributors unlock hidden/high-value spots for free.

Timetable-linked nudges: 10 minutes before a gap, push “3 quiet spots within 8 minutes.”

Crowding confidence: v1 = last-60-min check-ins & dwell times; v1.5 = operator peak-time audits; v2 = telco/Wi-Fi data if/when available.

Monetization experiments (prioritized)

Premium KRW 1,900/month: hidden spots, peak-time forecasts, offline map.

Sponsor slots: 2–3 local nap/study cafés per campus.

Native ads: After 5th list item (user-toggle early on).

B2B inventory: Building owners/campus units can surface “available lounges” (monthly fee).

Risk controls

Community compliance: value-first posts, limited frequency, transparent sources.

Privacy-by-design: minimal data, on-device processing where possible.

Fake check-ins: GPS speed/accel, short-dwell discounting, optional Bluetooth beacons; battery impact constraints.

<product_execution>
North Star & KPIs

North Star: First-Try Rest Rate (FTRR) — % of sessions where users start resting within 5 minutes at the first recommended spot.

Activation: Timetable connected + first check-in completed.

Targets (initial)

Landing→Install conversion ≥ 20%

D1/D7/D30: 45% / 30% / 20%

FTRR ≥ 60% (≥50% during exam peaks)

Contributor rate ≥ 15% of MAU monthly

MRR ≥ KRW 2M by Month 12 (3–5% paywall conversion; ARPPU KRW 1,900–2,900 + sponsors)

Trade-offs to hit metrics

Focus on students only in v1; defer office workers/commuters.

Founder-operator mindset: accept manual ops & monetization hustling early.

Defer non-core features (chat, extensive social graph, citywide coverage).

Hypotheses

H1: Users can find a seat on first try using our app.

H2: Our crowding score correlates with perceived crowding/noise (r ≥ 0.5).

H3: Streaks lift D7 retention by ≥ +8 pp.

H4: Hidden spots increase paid conversion by ≥ +50% vs. control.

Validation plan

Day-1 concierge test: Curate 15 spots in Google Sheets → publish MyMap. Collect 30 timetables via Google Form; send Kakao recommendations. Measure FTRR, time-to-seat, satisfaction (5-pt), NPS, contribution intent.

One-week no-code MVP (Glide/Adalo/Thunkable): list & filters, check-in, streaks, contribution form, points. Operator checklist for peak audits.

A/B: distance-first vs. quiet-first ranking; compare FTRR & D1/D7.

Goals: DAU 100, 300 check-ins/day, 30 contributions/day, D7 ≥ 30%.

MVP scope

P0: Timetable input (manual or screenshot OCR), location, ranked list (time-left, walk time, crowding/noise/seat badges), check-in & dwell timer, contribution form, operator console (Notion/Sheets).

P1: Streaks, contribution points, hidden spots (whitelist).

Data & basic tech

Events: view_spot, request_reco, start_rest, check_in, contribute_spot, streak_dayN, invite_sent/accepted, premium_trial_start.

Crowding v1: last-60-min check-ins × weighted dwell × contributor trust.

Anti-abuse: speed/accel heuristics, geofence, discount <5-min dwell.

Legal/operations

Location consent + retention policy (e.g., raw GPS deleted after 14 days; keep only aggregates).

Campus policy labels (e.g., “No use during class hours” flags).

In-app “Report inaccurate info” with 24h SLA.

Roadmap

Week 0: Concierge + no-code MVP in 1 campus.

Month 1: RN/Expo app skeleton, payments, 2 sponsors.

Months 2–3: Expand to 3 campuses; pilot telco/Wi-Fi signals.

Month 6: Crowding v2; MRR KRW 1M.

Month 12: 5 campuses; MRR ≥ KRW 2M, D60 ≥ 30%.
